And I wanna make this absolutely clear
We do not have anything to do with any rap group
Basically what we did
And well the way the process worked
Uh, happened, like I said, by accident
I met those people
And got involved sort of indirectly with them
Got with some other people and they said
"Well yeah! Let's see what happens"
And the idea of this is no chaos
No violence
No destruction
No firefights
No gunplay
Uh, or any kind of violence if possible
And, a lawful manner in which to conduct the operation
And that the only thing they cared about was sucking as much as they could
